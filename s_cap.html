    <h1>Surveillance Capitalism</h1>
</div>

<p>Surveillance Capitalism works by providing free services for people, and while they use the services the providers of the services monitor the users behavior; sometimes this happens without their explicit consent.

</p>
<p>Surveillance Capitalism was invented around 2001 as a solution to the dotcom bust. Google, who originally was against advertising, started using all the data exhaust to boost ad revenue. This made advertising as important as search.

</p>
<p>It is the default model for capital accumulation in Silicon Valley, including startups and apps. In 2008 Sheryl Sandberg brought surveillance capitalism from Google to Facebook.
</p>

<p>Nowadays, any product with the label “smart” or “personalized” is a branch of surveillance capitalism. “Once we searched Google, but now Google searches us. Once we thought of digital services as free, but now surveillance capitalists think of us as free.”

</p>
<p>It takes human experience and it translates it into behavioural data. This data can be used to improve service, but it is also used to predict what the user will do in the future.
</p>

<p>Surveillance creates an imbalance of power between those who are being watched and those who watch. Those with more information have more power than those who do not. It is difficult to ask for self regulation because that would mean stripping these companies down and having them start over. Like the banks, they’re too big to fail.
