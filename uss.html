        <h1>United States of Secrets: Edward Snowden <i class="fas fa-flag-usa"></i></h1>
        <h2>Where Did It All Begin?</h2>
        <p>The National Security Agency (NSA) felt responsible for 9/11 and wondered what they did wrong. There was a rising demand in the country to prevent the next terrorist attack. As a result, they created “The Program,” which was a domestic surveillance program that collected data on all U.S. citizens. This data included emails, texts, phone calls, social media interactions, etc. The Program analyzed all of this data that they had collected for suspicious activity. It was so highly classified that even some members of the NSA were unaware of its existence.
        </p>

        <h2>
            The Issues With The Program:
        </h2>
        <p>Prior to The Program, there was another program titled “ThinThread.” ThinThread analyzed data from networks of communications from all around the world. The NSA encrypted U.S. citizens’ data in ThinThread as a means of maintaining U.S. citizens’ privacy. After 9/11, an NSA employee stumbled upon “ThinThread,” and realized it could have prevented 9/11 and could be used to prevent similar attacks in the future. However, when he proposed the solution, he was denied as The Program had already been enforced. This particular NSA employee had not been told about The Program initially, but had eventually come to know of its existence. He was disappointed to find out that The Program was essentially the same as ThinThread, without the protections that encrypted American citizens’ data. He and the ThinThread team became concerned with the legality of The Program and decided to retire from the NSA.</p>
        <p>The President at the time, President Bush, was the one who authorized The Program, although technically the government did not have the proper warrants and permissions to proceed with the program. President Bush insisted that the government possessed the warrants, which disturbed Thomas Tamm, an NSA employee at the time. Thomas Tamm made the decision to leak The Program to the New York Times, but the White House had successfully convinced the magazine to not publish the story. However, a year later, one of the New York Times reporters threatened to write a book on The Program, publishing its secrets, which forced the New York Times to finally publish the story (despite failed efforts of convincing from the White House). President Bush, as well as the director of the NSA, are forced to admit to the existence of the program, but severely minimize its abilities and falsely claims that all NSA employees agree with it. After the leak to the New York Times, there were several other leaks but the government continued to deny/minimize the claims made. </p>

        <h2>Where Does Edward Snowden Fit Into This?</h2>
        <p>In the midst of this disaster, President Obama promises a fully transparent administration upon election and encourages a legal manner of domestic surveillance. Worried, President Bush rushed to pass the Fisa Amendment Act, which expanded and legalized The Program. Despite his previous statements, President Obama pushed the Act forward. Once inaugurated, President Obama kept The Program intact, even  defending, minimizing and lying about it. Angered by this, Edward Snowden, a young NSA Contractor in Japan who had long been disturbed by NSA’s surveillance takes action.</p>
        <p>While working, Edward Snowden had found a document containing the entire history of The Program. He felt that NSA’s actions were inappropriate and that they were not being properly held accountable for them. Snowden studied the actions of other whistleblowers before copying several confidential U.S. documents and handing them over to the press. Snowden also posed a video revealing his identity, in which he explains the NSA’s actions and his intentions in exposing them. Snowden is forced to go into hiding after the video and is later granted asylum in Russia. The Guardian published his story even though the White House tried to convince them not to. Snowden’s leak was one of, if not the biggest intelligence breaches in history.
        </p>

        <h2>What Else Was the NSA Up To? </h2>
        <p>The NSA also ran the PRISM Program, which involved nine technology companies cooperating with the NSA, giving them access to all of their data regarding their users. President Obama and the companies denied this program’s abilities. President Obama’s solution was to appoint a panel to supervise the NSA’s actions to ensure the prevention of another disaster.</p>
        <p>Along with the PRISM Program, the NSA was secretly extracting data from fiber optic cables overseas, collecting information through bulk, through the Muscular Program. The Muscular Program allowed the NSA to break into private data links that connect technology companies around the world. The government was taking all of this data from the companies without their consent, which ruined their integrity. </p>
