    <h1>Legal Aspects of Online Privacy <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i></h1>
    <h2>The Law Protects You</h2>
    <p>There are multiple privacy laws in place to protect users like you. Online privacy is protected by laws that date back to the seventies. There are a multitude of regulations that keep users and their information safe:
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The US Privacy Act of 1974</li>
            <li>COPPA</li>
            <li>CAN-SPAM</li>
            <li>FTC</li>
            <li>ECPA</li>
            <li>CFAA</li>
            <li>CAN-SPAM</li>
            <li>Financial Services Modernization Act</li>

        </ul>


    <h2>
        The US Privacy Act of 1974:
    </h2>
    <p>United States citizens have the right to access any data held by government agencies and a right to copy that data. They have the right to correct any information errors. Access to information is on a need to know basis. Sharing information between other federal (and non federal) agencies is restricted.


    </p>
    <h2>COPPA:</h2>
    <p>

        COPPA stands for Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and it was established in 1998. Its goal is to palace parents in control over what information can be collected about their young children. The law specifically prohibits online companies from asking for PII from children 12-and-under unless there’s verifiable parental consent. It requires websites to post an online privacy policy, collect only necessary personal information, and create and maintain reasonable security measures. What qualifies as personal information includes: first and last names, a home or physical address, online contact information, telephone numbers, social security numbers, etc.


    </p>
    <h2>CAN-SPAM Act:</h2>
    <p>CAN-SPAM stands for “Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act”. It was established in 2003. It sets the rules for commercial email. Establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to stop emails, and says the tough penalties that come from violations. It applies to all commercial messages, not only email. There are a lot of requirements to follow. There cannot be any false or misleading information in the header of a message, nor can there be deceptive subject lines. If a message is an ad it has to be identified as one. There has to be a clear way to opt out of receiving messages, and it has to be honored.
    </p>

    <h2>FTC:</h2>
    <p>The FTC( Federal Trade Commission) Act regulates unfair or deceptive commercial practices. The FTC is the main federal regulator in the privacy area and brings enforcement of actions against companies. It punishes companies that violate privacy policies or that fail to protect federal information.
    </p>

    <h2>ECPA:</h2>
    <p>ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) was established in 1986. It protects communications (wire, oral, and electronic) from unauthorized interception, access, use and disclosure.
    </p>
    <h2>CFAA:</h2>
    <p>CFAA (Computer Fraud & Abuse Act) was established in 1986 and it has been amended six times. It makes it unlawful for certain computer related activities involving the unauthorized access of any computer that has prohibited information. It prohibits knowingly accessing a computer without authorization to obtain government restricted data. It also prohibits the transmit of harmful items, or traffic of computer passwords.
    </p>

    <h2>Financial Services Modernization Act:</h2>
    <p>It was established in 1999 and it regulates the collection and use of personal information collected and or held by financial institutions. It requires that the customer be notified and that it has an information security program.
